# Lunafish01-portfolio

## Description

- As a new developer I wanted to figure out a way to showcase my skill set and projects all in one place. My intention is to provide a simple to navigate portfolio where future employers and potential colleagues can see my skill set and projects completed. 

- I'm also currently working through the UTSA 24 week coding bootcamp and as a way to document my journey I created the portfolio to showcase the projects completed along my journey. 

- This protfolio will allow future users to contact me and visit my GitHub repository

- This project will showcase newly acquired skills with advanced CSS concepts, Media Query, Responsive Design, HTML and CSS structure and workflow
